this is a repository where I will be keeping all of my CS3013 stuff.

## Project 1

Making a GUI tool called mid-day commander. The goal of this project is to learn more about man pages and linux commands. In addition there is some basic concurrency used to spawn programs. This is done using the fork() and exec() commands.
